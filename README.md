## 🌏 [Project 1: Migration Trends in Australia (1996–2016)]()

**Tools used**: Power BI, Microsoft Excel, CSV datasets from ABS  
**Skills applied**: Dashboard design, storytelling with data, slicers and filters, regional comparison, demographic analysis
This project was part of my university coursework at Macquarie University (BUSA8031). The goal was to analyze migration and population trends across Australia from 1996 to 2016 using interactive dashboards.
**🧠 Key Features**:
- 3 Dashboards exploring total population, migrant origins, and settlement patterns
- Slicers by **state**, **age group**, **gender**, and **country of birth**
- Comparative visuals: **Asia vs Europe migration**, **NSW vs VIC settlement**, and **workforce age groups**
**📌 Insights:**
- NSW and Victoria remain the most popular states due to better jobs and economy
- Migration from Asia has grown faster than from Europe since 1996
- Most migrants from China, India, and England are in the working-age group (20–65)
