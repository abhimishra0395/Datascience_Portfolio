**🧠 Key Features**:
- 3 Dashboards exploring total population, migrant origins, and settlement patterns
- Slicers by **state**, **age group**, **gender**, and **country of birth**
- Comparative visuals: **Asia vs Europe migration**, **NSW vs VIC settlement**, and **workforce age groups**
**📌 Insights:**
- NSW and Victoria remain the most popular states due to better jobs and economy
- Migration from Asia has grown faster than from Europe since 1996
- Most migrants from China, India, and England are in the working-age group (20–65)
